# Decentralgraph frontend

Now in [Beta](https://decentralgraph.com)!

DG's frontend is bread-and-butter Create-React-App / Redux frontend with some D3 simulation and Three.js 3d visuals sprinkled in in hopes of being the most explorery blockchain explorer.

# Running

With Node.js 16 or above installed, run:

```
npm i && npm start
```

to run open the web app in developer mode.  You can also set STAY_LOCAL=true in frontend/src/config.ts to remove the backend as a dependency entirely and use a random chain instead.

# TODO: A lot more docs, but,

 here's some boilerplate Create-React-App docs for you!  This is fundamentally and deliberately a bread-and-butter create-react-app so you can use it as a mental default....

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
